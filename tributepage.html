      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj (1630–1680) was a visionary Indian ruler and the founder of the Maratha Empire in western India. Born in the hill fort of Shivneri near Junnar in present-day Maharashtra, he belonged to the Bhonsle Maratha clan. His father, Shahaji Bhonsle, was a prominent general who served the Deccan Sultanates, while his mother, Jijabai, deeply influenced him with stories of Hindu epics and a strong sense of pride in Indian culture and heritage. From a young age, Shivaji displayed leadership qualities and strategic brilliance. He began establishing his rule by capturing forts and consolidating power in the Pune region, ultimately breaking away from the Bijapur Sultanate. Shivaji's military tactics were innovative and focused on guerrilla warfare, fortification, and mobility, which helped him overcome more powerful enemies. Over time, he came into conflict with the Mughal Empire, notably with Emperor Aurangzeb. Although Shivaji once entered into a temporary alliance with the Mughals and was given the title of Raja, he later resumed his independent stance. In 1674, he was formally crowned as Chhatrapati at Raigad Fort, marking the foundation of a sovereign Maratha kingdom. He built a capable administration that welcomed people of all backgrounds, including Muslims and Europeans, and is remembered for his fair governance, respect for women, and promotion of regional languages. Shivaji also formed a naval force to secure the western coastline from foreign invasions, especially the Portuguese and Siddis. His legacy was revived in the 19th and 20th centuries by reformers like Jyotirao Phule and nationalists such as Bal Gangadhar Tilak, and he remains a symbol of courage, unity, and resistance against oppression in Indian history.
